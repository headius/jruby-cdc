*** WARNING ***

The RubySpec files in 'spec/ruby' dir are not intended
to be edited directly, since the location is not safe,
and will be deleted/recreated every time there is a
spec version update!!! Also, 'ant clean-all' will
delete the whole directory.

If you have some modified files in spec/ruby directory,
chances are that you might lose your changes!!!

If you'd like to modify the ruby spec files, consider
using the standalone RubySpec repository outside of
JRuby tree.

More info about RubySpec can be found here:
http://rubyspec.org/projects/show/rubyspec

JRuby-specific info can be found here:
