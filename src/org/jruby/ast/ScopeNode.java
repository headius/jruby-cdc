/**
 * Scope in the parse tree.
 * indicates where in the parse tree a new scope should be started when evaling.
 * Unlike many node this is not created directly as part of the parce process,
 * rather it is created as a side effect of other things like creating a ClassNode
 * or SClassNode.  It can also be created by evaling a DefnNode or DefsNode as
 * part of the call to copyNodeScope.
