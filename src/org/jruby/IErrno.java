 * Error numbers.
 * @fixme
 * this interface is a big hack defining a bunch of arbitrary valor as system call error numbers
 * this is actually because I need them but will probably need to be changed to something smarter

 * The purpose of this class it to help implement the Errno module which in turn in needed by rubicon.
