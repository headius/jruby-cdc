  body: Create an AttlistDecl, pulling the information from a Source. Notice that this isn't very convenient; to create an AttlistDecl, you basically have to format it yourself, and then have the initializer parse it. Sorry, but for the forseeable future, DTD support in REXML is pretty weak on convenience. Have I mentioned how much I hate DTDs?
