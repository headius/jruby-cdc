  body: "Create a new entity. Simple entities can be constructed by passing a name, value to the constructor; this creates a generic, plain entity reference. For anything more complicated, you have to pass a Source to the constructor with the entity definiton, or use the accessor methods. <tt>WARNING</tt>: There is no validation of entity state except when the entity is read from a stream. If you start poking around with the accessors, you can easily create a non-conformant Entity. The best thing to do is dump the stupid DTDs and use XMLSchema instead."
