- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Ping contains routines to test for the reachability of remote hosts. Currently the only routine implemented is pingecho().
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Ping.pingecho uses a TCP echo (not an ICMP echo) to determine if the remote host is reachable. This is usually adequate to tell that a remote host is available to telnet, ftp, or ssh to.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Warning: Ping.pingecho may block for a long time if DNS resolution is slow. Requiring 'resolv-replace' allows non-blocking name resolution."

  body: "Usage:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB
