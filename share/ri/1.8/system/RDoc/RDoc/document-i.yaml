- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Format up one or more files according to the given arguments. For simplicity, <em>argv</em> is an array of strings, equivalent to the strings that would be passed on the command line. (This isn't a coincidence, as we <em>do</em> pass in ARGV when running interactively). For a list of options, see rdoc/rdoc.rb. By default, output will be stored in a directory called <tt>doc</tt> below the current directory, so make sure you're somewhere writable before invoking.
