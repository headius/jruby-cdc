  body: When this module is included in another, Ruby calls <tt>append_features</tt> in this module, passing it the receiving module in <em>mod</em>. Ruby's default implementation is to add the constants, methods, and module variables of this module to <em>mod</em> if this module has not already been added to <em>mod</em> or one of its ancestors. See also <tt>Module#include</tt>.
