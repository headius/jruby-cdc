- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Decodes text formatted using a subset of RFC2047 (the one used for mime-encoding mail headers).
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Only supports an encoding type of 'b' (base 64), and only supports the character sets ISO-2022-JP and SHIFT_JIS (so the only two encoded word sequences recognized are <tt>=?ISO-2022-JP?B?...=</tt> and <tt>=?SHIFT_JIS?B?...=</tt>). Recognition of these sequences is case insensitive.
