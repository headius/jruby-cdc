- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Returns the class of <em>obj</em>, now preferred over <tt>Object#type</tt>, as an object's type in Ruby is only loosely tied to that object's class. This method must always be called with an explicit receiver, as <tt>class</tt> is also a reserved word in Ruby.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "   1.class      #=&gt; Fixnum\n   self.class   #=&gt; Object\n"
full_name: Object#class
is_singleton: false
