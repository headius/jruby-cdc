- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Returns the children of the directory (files and subdirectories, not recursive) as an array of Pathname objects. By default, the returned pathnames will have enough information to access the files. If you set <tt>with_directory</tt> to <tt>false</tt>, then the returned pathnames will contain the filename only.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "For example:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  p = Pathname(&quot;/usr/lib/ruby/1.8&quot;)\n  p.children\n      # -&gt; [ Pathname:/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/English.rb,\n             Pathname:/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/Env.rb,\n             Pathname:/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/abbrev.rb, ... ]\n  p.children(false)\n      # -&gt; [ Pathname:English.rb, Pathname:Env.rb, Pathname:abbrev.rb, ... ]\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Note that the result never contain the entries <tt>.</tt> and <tt>..</tt> in the directory because they are not children.
