- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Calls <em>block</em> once for each key in <em>hsh</em>, passing the key and value to the block as a two-element array. Because of the assignment semantics of block parameters, these elements will be split out if the block has two formal parameters. Also see <tt>Hash.each_pair</tt>, which will be marginally more efficient for blocks with two parameters.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "   h = { &quot;a&quot; =&gt; 100, &quot;b&quot; =&gt; 200 }\n   h.each {|key, value| puts &quot;#{key} is #{value}&quot; }\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: <em>produces:</em>
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "   a is 100\n   b is 200\n"
