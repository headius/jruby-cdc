  body: Provides a mechanism for issuing low-level commands to control or query file-oriented I/O streams. Arguments and results are platform dependent. If <em>arg</em> is a number, its value is passed directly. If it is a string, it is interpreted as a binary sequence of bytes (<tt>Array#pack</tt> might be a useful way to build this string). On Unix platforms, see <tt>fcntl(2)</tt> for details. Not implemented on all platforms.
