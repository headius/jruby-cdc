- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The trick here is doing a match where you grab one <b>line</b> of input at a time. The linebreak may or may not occur at the boundary where the string matches a format specifier. And if it does, some rule about whitespace may or may not be in effect...
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: That's why this is much more elaborate than the string version.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "For each line: Match succeeds (non-emptily) and the last attempted spec/string sub-match succeeded:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  could the last spec keep matching?\n    yes: save interim results and continue (next line)\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "The last attempted spec/string did not match:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: are we on the next-to-last spec in the string?
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  yes:\n    is fmt_string.string_left all spaces?\n      yes: does current spec care about input space?\n        yes: fatal failure\n        no: save interim results and continue\n  no: continue  [this state could be analyzed further]\n"
