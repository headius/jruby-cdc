- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Pushes back one character (passed as a parameter) onto <em>ios</em>, such that a subsequent buffered read will return it. Only one character may be pushed back before a subsequent read operation (that is, you will be able to read only the last of several characters that have been pushed back). Has no effect with unbuffered reads (such as <tt>IO#sysread</tt>).
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "   f = File.new(&quot;testfile&quot;)   #=&gt; #&lt;File:testfile&gt;\n   c = f.getc                 #=&gt; 84\n   f.ungetc(c)                #=&gt; nil\n   f.getc                     #=&gt; 84\n"
