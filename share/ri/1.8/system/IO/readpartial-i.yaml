- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Reads at most <em>maxlen</em> bytes from the I/O stream. It blocks only if <em>ios</em> has no data immediately available. It doesn't block if some data available. If the optional <em>outbuf</em> argument is present, it must reference a String, which will receive the data. It raises <tt>EOFError</tt> on end of file.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: readpartial is designed for streams such as pipe, socket, tty, etc. It blocks only when no data immediately available. This means that it blocks only when following all conditions hold.
- !ruby/object:SM::Flow::LIST 
  contents: 
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: the buffer in the IO object is empty.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: the content of the stream is empty.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: the stream is not reached to EOF.
  type: :BULLET
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: When readpartial blocks, it waits data or EOF on the stream. If some data is reached, readpartial returns with the data. If EOF is reached, readpartial raises EOFError.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: When readpartial doesn't blocks, it returns or raises immediately. If the buffer is not empty, it returns the data in the buffer. Otherwise if the stream has some content, it returns the data in the stream. Otherwise if the stream is reached to EOF, it raises EOFError.

- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Note that readpartial behaves similar to sysread. The differences are:"
- !ruby/object:SM::Flow::LIST 
  contents: 
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: If the buffer is not empty, read from the buffer instead of &quot;sysread for buffered IO (IOError)&quot;.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: It doesn't cause Errno::EAGAIN and Errno::EINTR. When readpartial meets EAGAIN and EINTR by read system call, readpartial retry the system call.
  type: :BULLET
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The later means that readpartial is nonblocking-flag insensitive. It blocks on the situation IO#sysread causes Errno::EAGAIN as if the fd is blocking mode.
