- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Reads the next ``line'' from the I/O stream; lines are separated by <em>sep_string</em>. A separator of <tt>nil</tt> reads the entire contents, and a zero-length separator reads the input a paragraph at a time (two successive newlines in the input separate paragraphs). The stream must be opened for reading or an <tt>IOError</tt> will be raised. The line read in will be returned and also assigned to <tt>$_</tt>. Returns <tt>nil</tt> if called at end of file.
