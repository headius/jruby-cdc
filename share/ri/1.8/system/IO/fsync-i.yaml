  body: Immediately writes all buffered data in <em>ios</em> to disk. Returns <tt>nil</tt> if the underlying operating system does not support <em>fsync(2)</em>. Note that <tt>fsync</tt> differs from using <tt>IO#sync=</tt>. The latter ensures that data is flushed from Ruby's buffers, but doesn't not guarantee that the underlying operating system actually writes it to disk.
