  body: Open a client connection to <tt>uri</tt> with the configuration <tt>config</tt>.

  body: The DRbProtocol module asks each registered protocol in turn to try to open the URI. Each protocol signals that it does not handle that URI by raising a DRbBadScheme error. If no protocol recognises the URI, then a DRbBadURI error is raised. If a protocol accepts the URI, but an error occurs in opening it, a DRbConnError is raised.
