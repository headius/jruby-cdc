  body: Open a server listening for connections at <tt>uri</tt> with configuration <tt>config</tt>.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The DRbProtocol module asks each registered protocol in turn to try to open a server at the URI. Each protocol signals that it does not handle that URI by raising a DRbBadScheme error. If no protocol recognises the URI, then a DRbBadURI error is raised. If a protocol accepts the URI, but an error occurs in opening it, the underlying error is passed on to the caller.
