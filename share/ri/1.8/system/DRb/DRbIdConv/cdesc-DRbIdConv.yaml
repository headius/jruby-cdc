- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This, the default implementation, uses an object's local ObjectSpace <em>id</em> as its id. This means that an object's identification over drb remains valid only while that object instance remains alive within the server runtime.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: For alternative mechanisms, see DRb::TimerIdConv in rdb/timeridconv.rb and DRbNameIdConv in sample/name.rb in the full drb distribution.
