- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: If an object is returned by a method invoked over drb, but the class of the object is unknown in the client namespace, or the object is a constant unknown in the client namespace, then the still-marshalled object is returned wrapped in a DRbUnknown instance.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: If this object is passed as an argument to a method invoked over drb, then the wrapped object is passed instead.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The class or constant name of the object can be read from the <tt>name</tt> attribute. The marshalled object is held in the <tt>buf</tt> attribute.
