- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Ruby tries to load the library named <em>string</em>, returning <tt>true</tt> if successful. If the filename does not resolve to an absolute path, it will be searched for in the directories listed in <tt>$:</tt>. If the file has the extension ``.rb'', it is loaded as a source file; if the extension is ``.so'', ``.o'', or ``.dll'', or whatever the default shared library extension is on the current platform, Ruby loads the shared library as a Ruby extension. Otherwise, Ruby tries adding ``.rb'', ``.so'', and so on to the name. The name of the loaded feature is added to the array in <tt>$&quot;</tt>. A feature will not be loaded if it's name already appears in <tt>$&quot;</tt>. However, the file name is not converted to an absolute path, so that ``<tt>require 'a';require './a'</tt>'' will load <tt>a.rb</tt> twice.
