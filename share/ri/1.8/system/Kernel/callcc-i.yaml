  body: Generates a <tt>Continuation</tt> object, which it passes to the associated block. Performing a <em>cont</em><tt>.call</tt> will cause the <tt>callcc</tt> to return (as will falling through the end of the block). The value returned by the <tt>callcc</tt> is the value of the block, or the value passed to <em>cont</em><tt>.call</tt>. See class <tt>Continuation</tt> for more details. Also see <tt>Kernel::throw</tt> for an alternative mechanism for unwinding a call stack.
