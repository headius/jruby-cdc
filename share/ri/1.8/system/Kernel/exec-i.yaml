- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Replaces the current process by running the given external <em>command</em>. If <tt>exec</tt> is given a single argument, that argument is taken as a line that is subject to shell expansion before being executed. If multiple arguments are given, the second and subsequent arguments are passed as parameters to <em>command</em> with no shell expansion. If the first argument is a two-element array, the first element is the command to be executed, and the second argument is used as the <tt>argv[0]</tt> value, which may show up in process listings. In MSDOS environments, the command is executed in a subshell; otherwise, one of the <tt>exec(2)</tt> system calls is used, so the running command may inherit some of the environment of the original program (including open file descriptors).
