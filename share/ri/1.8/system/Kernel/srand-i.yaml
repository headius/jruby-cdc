  body: Seeds the pseudorandom number generator to the value of <em>number</em>.<tt>to_i.abs</tt>. If <em>number</em> is omitted, seeds the generator using a combination of the time, the process id, and a sequence number. (This is also the behavior if <tt>Kernel::rand</tt> is called without previously calling <tt>srand</tt>, but without the sequence.) By setting the seed to a known value, scripts can be made deterministic during testing. The previous seed value is returned. Also see <tt>Kernel::rand</tt>.
