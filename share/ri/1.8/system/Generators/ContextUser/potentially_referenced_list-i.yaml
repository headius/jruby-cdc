  body: "Build a list from an array of <em>Htmlxxx</em> items. Look up each in the AllReferences hash: if we find a corresponding entry, we generate a hyperlink to it, otherwise just output the name. However, some names potentially need massaging. For example, you may require a Ruby file without the .rb extension, but the file names we know about may have it. To deal with this, we pass in a block which performs the massaging, returning an array of alternative names to match"
