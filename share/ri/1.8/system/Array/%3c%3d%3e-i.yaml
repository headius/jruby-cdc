- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Comparison---Returns an integer (-1, 0, or +1) if this array is less than, equal to, or greater than other_array. Each object in each array is compared (using &lt;=&gt;). If any value isn't equal, then that inequality is the return value. If all the values found are equal, then the return is based on a comparison of the array lengths. Thus, two arrays are ``equal'' according to <tt>Array#&lt;=&gt;</tt> if and only if they have the same length and the value of each element is equal to the value of the corresponding element in the other array.
