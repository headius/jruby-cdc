- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Creates a new Net::IMAP object and connects it to the specified <tt>port</tt> (143 by default) on the named <tt>host</tt>. If <tt>usessl</tt> is true, then an attempt will be made to use SSL (now TLS) to connect to the server. For this to work OpenSSL [OSSL] and the Ruby OpenSSL [RSSL] extensions need to be installed. The <tt>certs</tt> parameter indicates the path or file containing the CA cert of the server, and the <tt>verify</tt> parameter is for the OpenSSL verification callback.
