  body: "  LOGIN:: login using cleartext user and password.\n  CRAM-MD5:: login with cleartext user and encrypted password\n             (see [RFC-2195] for a full description).

- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "For both these mechanisms, there should be two <tt>args</tt>: username and (cleartext) password. A server may not support one or other of these mechanisms; check #capability() for a capability of the form &quot;AUTH=LOGIN&quot; or &quot;AUTH=CRAM-MD5&quot;."
