- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Gets data from <tt>path</tt> on the connected-to host. <tt>header</tt> must be a Hash like { 'Accept' =&gt; '*/*', ... }.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: In version 1.1 (ruby 1.6), this method returns a pair of objects, a Net::HTTPResponse object and the entity body string. In version 1.2 (ruby 1.8), this method returns a Net::HTTPResponse object.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: If called with a block, yields each fragment of the entity body in turn as a string as it is read from the socket. Note that in this case, the returned response object will <b>not</b> contain a (meaningful) body.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: <tt>dest</tt> argument is obsolete. It still works but you must not use it.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: In version 1.1, this method might raise an exception for 3xx (redirect). In this case you can get a HTTPResponse object by &quot;anException.response&quot;.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: In version 1.2, this method never raises exception.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "    # version 1.1 (bundled with Ruby 1.6)\n    response, body = http.get('/index.html')\n\n    # version 1.2 (bundled with Ruby 1.8 or later)\n    response = http.get('/index.html')\n\n    # using block\n    File.open('result.txt', 'w') {|f|\n      http.get('/~foo/') do |str|\n        f.write str\n      end\n    }\n"
