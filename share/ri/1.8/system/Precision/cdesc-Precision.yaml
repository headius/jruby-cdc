  body: Precision is a mixin for concrete numeric classes with precision. Here, `precision' means the fineness of approximation of a real number, so, this module should not be included into anything which is not a subset of Real (so it should not be included in classes such as <tt>Complex</tt> or <tt>Matrix</tt>).
