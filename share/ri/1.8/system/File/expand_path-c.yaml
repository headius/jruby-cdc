  body: Converts a pathname to an absolute pathname. Relative paths are referenced from the current working directory of the process unless <em>dir_string</em> is given, in which case it will be used as the starting point. The given pathname may start with a ``<tt>~</tt>'', which expands to the process owner's home directory (the environment variable <tt>HOME</tt> must be set correctly). ``<tt>~</tt><em>user</em>'' expands to the named user's home directory.
