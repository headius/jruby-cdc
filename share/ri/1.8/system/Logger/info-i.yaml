- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Log an <tt>INFO</tt> message.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The message can come either from the <tt>progname</tt> argument or the <tt>block</tt>. If both are provided, then the <tt>block</tt> is used as the message, and <tt>progname</tt> is used as the program name.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::H 
  level: 3
  text: Examples
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  logger.info(&quot;MainApp&quot;) { &quot;Received connection from #{ip}&quot; }\n  # ...\n  logger.info &quot;Waiting for input from user&quot;\n  # ...\n  logger.info { &quot;User typed #{input}&quot; }\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: You'll probably stick to the second form above, unless you want to provide a program name (which you can do with <tt>Logger#progname=</tt> as well).
