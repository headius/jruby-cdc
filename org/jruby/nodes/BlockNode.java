/**
 * A structuring node (linked list of other nodes).
 * This type of node is used to structure the AST.
 * It is used to build a linked list
 * the meaning of the Node fields for BlockNodes is:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * u1 ==&gt; head the node in this link
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * u2 ==&gt; end the last link of the list
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * u3 ==&gt; next the next link
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * this nodes are created through the {@link NodeFactory#newBlock newBlock} 
 * method.  This method is in turned invoked by the parser directly but also
 * by the {@link org.jruby.parser.ParserHelper#block_append block_append} method
