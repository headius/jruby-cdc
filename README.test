Procedures/Standards for testing:

Software Requirements
---------------------
Testing is done with JUnit (http://www.junit.org).
To run the JUnit ant tasks, you also need the optional ant tasks jar file from http://jakarta.apache.org/site/binindex.html

The default build.xml is setup to look for the JUnit jar file under $JRUBY_HOME/lib.  The optional ant tasks should be put in $ANT_HOME/lib/optional.jar.


Writing Tests
-------------

1) Java unit tests with JUnit:

Tests for classes should be put in a "test" subpackage of the original class's package.  For example, org.jruby.RubyModule's tests should go in org.jruby.test.  Test files should be named: Test${classname}.java (e.g. TestRubyModule.java).  After creating individual tests, each test class should be added to the main test suite at org.jruby.test.MainTestSuite.

Before checking in your changes, be sure to run the full test suite with the following command line:

	ant test

..or, if you don't have the ant JUnit task:

	java junit.textui.TestRunner org.jruby.test.MainTestSuite

This will ensure that your changes not only work by themselves but haven't caused problems elsewhere in the source.

Unit tests should ALWAYS run at 100% pass rate when checked into CVS.


2) Ruby tests with minirunit:

When implementing new methods on the builtin classes the easiest way is to write the tests in Ruby. It also makes it possible to verify the tests against the original Ruby interpreter (MRI).
In the folder "test" you will find JRuby's own tests, and in "test/mri" some tests taken from MRI. Run all of them with:

        jruby.sh test/testSuite.rb
or
        jruby.bat test/testSuite.rb


3) Using Rubicon:

To use Rubicon for testing you must first install it, get it from CVS by using the CVSROOT :pserver:anonymous@cvs.ruby-lang.org:/src
and getting module rubicon.  You'll then need to build a few small c programs, you should follow the rubicon instructions in the README
which comes with it.
Rubicon requires that your configuration for the jruby installation be correct, for this you should first copy other the lib directory
from a compatible (1.6.7 for now but any 1.6 should work) version to your JRUBY_HOME directory (if you built jruby from CVS it is the build
directory).  You should then run jruby mkconfig.rb.  You are then set to go in your rubicon directory and run the tests.
