Procedures/Standards for testing:

Software Requirements
---------------------
Testing is done with JUnit (http://www.junit.org).
To run the JUnit ant tasks, you also need the optional ant tasks jar file from http://jakarta.apache.org/site/binindex.html

The default build.xml is setup to look for the JUnit jar file under $JRUBY_HOME/lib.  The optional ant tasks should be put in $ANT_HOME/lib/optional.jar.


Writing Tests
-------------
Tests for classes should be put in a "test" subpackage of the original class's package.  For example, org.jruby.RubyModule's tests should go in org.jruby.test.  Test files should be named: Test${classname}.java (e.g. TestRubyModule.java).  After creating individual tests, each test class should be added to the main test suite at org.jruby.test.MainTestSuite.

Before checking in your changes, be sure to run the full test suite with the following command line:

	ant test

..or, if you don't have the ant JUnit task:

	java junit.textui.TestRunner org.jruby.test.MainTestSuite

This will ensure that your changes not only work by themselves but haven't caused problems elsewhere in the source.

Unit tests should ALWAYS run at 100% pass rate when checked into CVS.
