Developer's Glossary
--------------------


Block:

    The thing with {}. [Anything about what blockStack is?]


Frame:

	A Frame is used to represent the actual method (or block) context. Each method
	(or block) call a new Frame will be pushed on a FrameStack. In a Frame stack
	the name of the actual method, the class in which the method is implemented
	and the arguments will be stored. For example it is used to create Exception
	backtraces and to call the correct super method.

Iter:

    [Probably short for Iterator, but what *is* it? Seems to have something to do with
    passing blocks.]


MRI (Matz' Ruby Interpreter):

    The original Ruby interpreter, implemented in C.


Scope:
	Scopes are used to store local variables and to store the actual method-
	visibility which is used when a new method is created.
	The scope of a local variable ranges from class, module, def or
	do to the corresponding end.
	It is implemented in JRuby as a stack (ScopeStack) of Scope objects.
	Each Scope contains an array of IRubyObjects (localValues) which is used
	to store the local variables and an array of Strings (localNames) which 
	is used	to store the names of the local variables.

Variable, Block:

    See Variable, Dynamic.


Variable, Dynamic:

    Similar to a Local Variable, used for Block arguments.


Variable, Local:

    Variable with a local Scope.
