Block:

    The thing with {}. [Anything about what blockStack is?]


Frame:

    [What is it, and how does it differ from Scope?]

    passing blocks.]


MRI (Matz' Ruby Interpreter):

    The original Ruby interpreter, implemented in C.


Scope:

    [The extent of a Local Variable? What language constructs create new scopes?
    How does it work internally?]
