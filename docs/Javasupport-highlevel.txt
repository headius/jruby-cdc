Module:

    instance methods:

    include_package( aString )

        Includes a Java package into this class/module. The Java
        classes in the package will become available in this
        class/module, unless a constant with the same name as a Java
        class is already defined.

        Example:

            module MyModule
              include_package "java.util"

              # Create an instance of java.util.Random
              random = Random.new

              # Call a Java method
              random.nextInt                  # -> some Fixnum
              # Call another Java method
              random.nextInt(10)              # -> some Fixnum (0..9)
            end
