<h1>JRuby Limitations</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p><em><b>Note:</b> This is a brand new document (as of 0.8.2 release).  It
is a rough draft and will get filled in more as time permits.</em></p>

<p>JRuby is an alternate implementation of the Ruby programming language.  It 
is also an embedded language for the Java Virtual machine (JVM).  On both of 
these fronts, we have a set of limitations that a user should be aware of.</p>

<p>When we outline each limitation, we will note whether we think that the
limitation is likely to go away and JRuby matures.  In some cases, we cannot
implement features because the underlying JVM does not allow it.  In other
cases, it is simply not implemented yet.</p>

<h2>Ruby conformance Limitations</h2>

<p>This section reflects known incompatibilities between Ruby and JRuby.
It is by no means comprehensive.  It just reflects larger issues we are
aware of.  The fact that Ruby does not have a language specification also
makes having an exact delta between the two implementations impossible.</p>

<ul>
<li>Does not support continuations/bindings.</li>

<p>These features are simply missing.  There is nothing which prevents them
from existing short of programmer effort.</p>

<li>Fine-grained timer.</li>

<p>Benchmarking code depends on finer grained timings than the JVM supports.
This may be solved in a future JVM as there is a JSR on this (which JSR?).</p>

<li>Identical thread behavior</li>

<p>Ruby uses green threads to implement the languages threading library.  JRuby
uses Java threads to implement Thread and friends.  Without actually 
implementing green threads ourselves, we will not have identical thread
behavior.  Hopefully, any sane multi-threaded ruby script will work ok in
spite of this</p>

<li>Missing File operations</li>

<p>The JVM is missing some file operations needed by File and friends in
Ruby.  Some JSRs exist which may fix some of these and we could perhaps
call external scripts to perform the rest.  This is an area we have not
spent any time looking at.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Java Limitations</h2>

<ul>

<li>Cannot extend abstract classes</li>

<p>Even though we can implement interfaces, we cannot extend abstract classes.
This is for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Javas Proxy (which we use to pull in java classes) does not allow proxying an abstract class</li>
<li>Java consumers cannot see what we are extending (see next item on list)</li>
</ul>

<p>This feature will work once we have a compiler</p>

</p>

<li>Extended Java Classes in Ruby will not be visible to Java consumers</li>

<p>Consider the following code:</p>

<pre class="code">
include_class 'java.util.ArrayList'

class MyList < ArrayList
  def toString
    "MYLIST"
  end
end
</pre>

<p>If we send an instance of MyList to a java object which calls toString
on it; it will NOT call the toString we defined on it.  This will be fixed
once we have a compiler.</p>

</ul>
